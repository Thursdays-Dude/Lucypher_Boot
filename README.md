# Lucypher_Boot

You know.. I try to start 2018 in style so I've began to create my own OS just for pure satisfaction. 
So I made this project public in case someone wanna play alongside to create LucypherOS with me.

Trying now to create basic boot sequence in pure x64 while using Virtual Box's EUFI Terminal.

Enjoy,
The Thursdays-Dude
